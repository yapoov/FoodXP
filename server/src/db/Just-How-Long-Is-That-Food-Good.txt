TOMATO BULLETIN ~~ TOMATO BULLETIN ~~ TOMATO BULLETIN ~~ TOMATO BULLETIN
DON'T REFRIGERATE YOUR TOMATOES!!
Most fresh tomatoes sold in supermarkets are firm, not yet ripe.
This is because soft, ripe fruit is easily bruised, even under
today's highly-controlled shipping conditions. But the fruit will
ripen properly and develop good flavor and aroma if kept at
room temperature, between 55° F and 70° F.
Select tomatoes at various degrees of ripeness and keep them at room
temperature. Use the ripest fruit first, just as your do with bananas and
avocados. Never refrigerate a tomato that is not fully red or ripe! Cold
temperatures destroy flavor and stop the ripening process. Once fully ripe,
a tomato can be refrigerated, but only for a few days; any longer results in
flavor deterioration.
Test for Ripeness!
To enjoy fresh tomatoes at their peak of flavor, use when fully ripe. Ripe
tomatoes should be completely red or reddish-orange, depending on
variety. They will have a sweet, subtle aroma and will give slightly to gentle
palm pressure.
To hasten ripening, place fresh tomatoes in a brown paper bag or in a fruit
ripening bowl. As the fruit ripens, it emits a natural gas--ethylene. This gas
speeds up the ripening process when confined around the fruit in a closed
bag or fruit ripening bowl.
This same ethylene gas can also be commercially applied to fresh tomatoes
and other fresh fruits. This external application initiates the natural ripening
process in such fruits as tomatoes, apples, bananas, and citrus. Numerous
studies show that externally applied ethylene does not change flavor or
nutritional potential.
For best flavor, remember... do not refrigerate your fresh Tomatoes.

• Shelf Life Varies, mainly according to product ingredients.
• Shelf-life refers to the amount of time a product can be
stored before its quality begins to diminish.
• Most non-dairy processed foods do not become unsafe
after that time, but they might not taste their best.
• Most non-dairy processed foods have a shelf life of three
months to two years, but the shelf life depends greatly on
handling and storage conditions
The following are conservative estimates:

Here’s How Long
You Can Keep These Foods……

HOW TO KNOW WHEN
FOOD IS SPOILED
People often wonder when a food is unfit for human consumption.
Many times, it is food, which has been refrigerated for an
undetermined amount of time and may be unsafe to eat.
Here are some common characteristics of spoiled foods:
FISH
Off odor Flesh easily pulled away from bones
Gray or greenish gills Mark of fingernail indentation remains in flesh
Sunken eyes Not rigid
RED MEAT
Off odor
Slimy to touch
Beef usually spoils first on the surface;
pork spoils first at meeting point of bone
and flesh in the inner portions.
DRESSED POULTRY
Off odor
Slimy to touch
Stickiness under wing, at the point where
legs and body join, and on the upper surface of
the tail.
Darkening of wing tip.
20
FRUITS & VEGETABLES
Obvious mold or rotten spot.
SALADS
Off odor
Chicken, tuna and other fish salads, no acid potato salad, all types of cold cuts must be
kept refrigerated at all times.
CANNED FOODS
Swelled top & bottom of can Signs of seepage
Dents along side seams Foam
Off odor Milkiness in juice
Home canned food such as canned
vegetables, meats, fish & poultry
should be cooked thoroughly before
eating, but when any of the above
OBVIOUS defects occur, THROW THE
CANNED FOOD AWAY properly, out of
the reach of children & animals.
21
CEREAL
Insects in cereal.
FROZEN FOODS
Frozen Foods will spoil if kept out of the
refrigerator for any great length of time.
LEFTOVER FOOD
Discoloration
Off color
Any food that has not been refrigerated below
45 degrees F may be considered slightly spoiled;
the off-odor of spoiled food is not always apparent;
don’t keep cooked food after 36 hours unless it is
cooked again.
Bacterial spoilage of food begins as soon as it becomes
warm; refrigeration will delay this spoilage.
CAUTION ~~ CAUTION ~~ CAUTION ~~ CAUTION ~~ CAUTION ~~ CAUTION ~~
It is not always possible to identify spoiled food by taste or appearance. Many foods taste and
appear to be safe and wholesome. Therefore, it is wise to observe the necessary precautions
in handling, storing and using foods, particularly during the summer months.
22
In areas where food items are stored, there is always an
increased probability of rats and mice. The can or box in which food is
stored may protect the product inside from rat or mouse droppings or
urine, but may not protect the person handling these containers or
eating/drinking from them.
A study by the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta discovered that the dust from dried rodent
droppings contains a harmful virus that can be ingested
if a person is not careful.
Obviously, protecting your storage areas from rats and mice is a
high priority. In addition, to be on the safe side, it is always good to
remember and follow these safety tips.
Most of us remember to wash vegetables & fruits but never think
of boxes & cans.
• Make sure that you wash the tops of any canned sodas or
goods thoroughly with running water and soap, if not
available drink with a straw.
• Always be careful to wipe off pasta packaging, cereal
boxes and other boxed goods.

False
1. E – If they smell fine, they are. Kept cool, these staples
can last days.
2. False – While fruit left out is generally safe, people have
gotten sick from melons – they are less acidic. Play it safe:
Serve slices over ice.
3. A – Never leave a meal in the heat for more than an
hour – and include the time it was in the car.
4. False – If raw meat has been soaking in it the marinade
is suspect. Set aside some of the sauce before you begin, an
apply it with a clean brush when the meat is done.
5. True – A dish must go from the oven to the dinner table
to the fridge in under four hours. Otherwise, bacteria will
have a chance to thrive in the danger zone – temperatures
between 41° and 140°.

THE DATING GAME
It’s breakfast time, and you’re craving a cheese omelet. Your carton of eggs says,
“EXPFEB12”; the cheddar says, “use by Feb. 23”; the milk says, “Sell by March 1.” It’s
March 4. Can you safely scramble, or should you switch to cereal, which is telling you,
“Best if used by 3-5”? If you’re unsure, you’re not alone. The boxes, cans, and cartons
in our kitchens are trying to tell us something, but we may not be getting the message.
Except for poultry, infant formula, and some baby food, product dating is not required by the federal
government, but more than 20 states mandate dating of some foods. When dates applied, generally
by the manufacturer and occasionally by the store, they’re stated in a variety of ways: You might see
Nov. 25, 11-25 or 1125. The terms used are somewhat flexible, too, since there’s no standard. Here,
words to the wise about the words on foods:
 “Use by,” “best if used by,” or “quality assurance” date: The last date the product is
likely to be at peak flavor or quality. One of these dates is often placed on foods such as
cereal, which may decline in flavor and quality. It doesn’t mean the food is unsafe after that
date.
 “Sell by” or “pull”: An indication, to the retailer, of the last day on which a product
should be sold. It takes into account time for the food to be stored and used at home. You
should buy it before the date, but don’t have to use it by then. You should be able to use
milk, say, for up to about seven days after the sell-by date.
 Pack or package date: The date the food – fresh meat, for example – was packed or
processed. Consumers can tell which package is fresher and choose that one. A pack date
isn’t an indication of safety.
 “Expiration”: For most foods, this indicates the last date on which they should be eaten
or used. Eggs are an exception: If you buy federally graded eggs before the expiration date
(which must be no more than 30 days from when they were put in the carton), you should be
able to use them safely for the next 3 to 5 weeks.
 “Born on”: Initiated by Anheuser-Busch, it’s supposed to let buyers choose the freshest
beer. According to the company, its beer is freshest and taste best with 110 days from the
born-on date.
 Coded date: A series of letters or numbers or both used to track foods across state lines
and, if necessary, recall them. The code isn’t meant as a use-by date.
 Other words to the wise: As a rule, high-acid canned foods such as tomatoes can be
stored on the shelf for 12 to 18 months; properly stored low-acid canned foods such as meat,
fish, and most vegetables will keep 2 to 5 years. Don’t use a can that’s bulging. If perishable
food are packaged and frozen properly, they will be safe to eat after the expiration date,
although the food may suffer freezer burn if its stored for a long time. And if a food bears a
date without words? Unfortunately, you’ll have to guess what it means.
